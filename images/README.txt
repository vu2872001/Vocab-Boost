ICON PLACEHOLDERS

This directory needs to contain the following icon files for the extension:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

Please create and add these icon files to this directory before loading the extension into Chrome.

Suggested icon design:
- Simple vocabulary-related imagery (like an open book, dictionary, or letter 'V')
- Consistent color scheme (blue tones match the extension's UI)
- Clear visibility at small sizes
- Transparent background

You can use any image editor to create these icons, such as:
- Adobe Photoshop
- GIMP (free)
- Figma
- Canva

Once created, replace this README with your icon files and the extension will be ready to use.
